## Problem Statement

### Dashboard 1: Summary

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:

1. **Total Loan Applications**: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
2. **Total Funded Amount**: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
3. **Total Amount Received**: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for asserting the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
4. **Average Interest Rate**: Calculating the average interest rate acorss all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
5. **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Mont-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.
